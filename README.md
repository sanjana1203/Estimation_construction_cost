# Construction Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning–based construction cost prediction system**.  
The model estimates the **overall construction cost** based on project-related features, supporting budget planning and cost analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Regression  
- **Domain:** Construction Management / Data Science  
- **Framework:** Python (Scikit-learn)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The project applies supervised learning techniques to predict construction expenses accurately.

## Model Details

- Uses **regression-based machine learning models**
